# Internal Employee Review Web App for Regis Corporation

This project is our final capstone project for Prime Digital Academy.  Work was completed by A. Brooks Nagel, Altamir Coehlo, Charlie Angus, and Sam Musselman.

We developed this application to meet the requirements and business needs of Regis Coporation, allowing them to transition from a paper/PDF review process to an electronic process.  Views are customized based on the user type and the state that the review is in (i.e. employee started, employee complete, leader started, leader complete, signed, etc.).

Developed using: Angular, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
